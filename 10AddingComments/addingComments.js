Example of comment with multiple line
In programming, a comment is a piece of text that is added
 to the source code of a program to provide additional
 information or to explain certain sections of the code.
 Comments are not executed by the computer, but rather
  are intended to be read by humans who are working with
   or reviewing the code.
